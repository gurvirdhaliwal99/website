			  <p>Love this place!!! My son and I come here all the time for the buffet. Best pizza ever... 
				Bathroom is very clean and small. Easy way for my 2 year old to use the toilet. 
				Staff here are very friendly and helpful.  I really enjoy watching my son run wild. 
				Make sure you come early at 11 if you have little toddlers. 
				Thanks Chucky Cheese staff for the best experience. -Nohemy and Jonathan</p>
			  <p>The kids love it! I didn't see a single kid not having fun. The bumper cars were genius, it actually made me wish I was 8 again. I literally asked for the weight limit. they had endless arcade games, a couple were a little off seemed like they needed some touching up. But 95% of all of the games were running well and they were SUPER FUN!
				pizza was really good, and the facility was really clean, and well kept.
				I took my 6 yr old son here, but I'm an adult and I just want to go back bc of the games and pizza again. I also didn't get an answer to that weight limit question because he thought I was joking....I wasn't. - Stacy</p>
			  <p>Brought some family and friends here for my child's birthday party. Great place for kids 12 and under. They left with full tummies and left tuckered out. They made a mistake with our food order and took over an hour to bring it out. But I give them credit because they owned up to their mistake and made up for it by not charging us for the item and throwing in some freebie stuff, as good service should be. They rectified their wrong and had pleasant staff. - David </p>
